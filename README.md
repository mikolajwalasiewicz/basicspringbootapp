Repository Summary:
Full-Stack Jokes App: Spring Boot & React

Repository Description:
This repository contains a full-stack web application developed using Spring Boot for the backend and React for the frontend. The application connects to a MariaDB database to store and manage a collection of jokes. Users can view random jokes, like them, and see the total number of likes. Each joke can be liked only once per session, ensuring a smooth and fair user experience.

Features:
  Backend: Spring Boot RESTful API with MariaDB integration.
  Frontend: React app for displaying and interacting with jokes.
  Like Functionality: Users can like each joke once per session; likes are stored and managed in the database.
  Animations: Smooth transitions and animations for better user interaction.
  State Management: Handling of session-based like limitations and dynamic content rendering.
  This project showcases my skills in full-stack development, integrating backend services with a modern frontend, and             creating interactive, user-friendly web applications.
